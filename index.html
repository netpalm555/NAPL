                <h3>What is NAPL?</h3>
                <p>NAPL stands for Nate's Amazing Programming Language. Yes, it might be a little narcissistic but that doesn't change the fact simply stated in the name. NAPL draws inspiration from programming languages such as Javascript, C++, Java, Python,
                    and LISP (what?!?! I actually enjoy some features of that language). There are some influences from other languages in NAPL but they are less distinct. NAPL is designed to be a function-oriented programming language. This means that
                    it functions are first-class citizens and can be passed to and returned by other functions. They are also the basic constructs for forming object-like structures (or what object-oriented programming languages refer to as objects).
                    One major difference between NAPL and other languages is the support for both dynamic and static typing. Dynamic variables are not type-checked and their type can change during runtime. Static variables are not allowed to change type
                    and are type-checked (and therefore their type is evaluated at compile time). Static variables have a small change as the type of a variable is inferred by the compiler so the programming does not need to specify the type.</p>
                <p>
                    I hope you enjoy NAPL as much as I enjoy creating and refining it.
                </p>
