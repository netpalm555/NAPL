# NAPL
NAPL stands for Nate'lexeme Amazing Programming Language. Yes, it might be a little narcissistic but that doesn't change the fact simply stated in the name. NAPL draws inspiration from programming languages such as Javascript, C++, Java, Python, and LISP (what?!?! I actually enjoy some features of that language). There are some influences from other languages in NAPL but they are less distinct. NAPL is designed to be a function-oriented programming language. This means that it functions are first-class citizens and can be passed to and returned by other functions. They are also the basic constructs for forming object-like structures (or what object-oriented programming languages refer to as objects). One major difference between NAPL and other languages is the support for both dynamic and static typing. Dynamic variables are not type-checked and their type can change during runtime. Static variables are not allowed to change type and are type-checked (and therefore their type is evaluated at compile time). Static variables have a small change as the type of a variable is inferred by the compiler so the programming does not need to specify the type.

I hope you enjoy NAPL as much as I enjoy creating and refining it.
